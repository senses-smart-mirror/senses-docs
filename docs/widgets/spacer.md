# Spacer

The Spacer widget is used to have some breathing room in between widgets. The spacer widget will not show anything but rather display empty pixels. 

## Screenshot

<div class="image-wrapper">
  <img class="widget-image" src="/images/widgets/spacer.png" alt="Spacer Widget" width="400"/>
</div>

## How to use

# Widget Introduction

Widgets are the components which provide the data on the Smart Mirror Screen. They can be added onto the Smart Mirror with the Senses - Smart Mirror App. 

#### Simple Widgets
Are widgets that requires no extra setup and can be used straight out of the box. The spacer, clock and profile widgets are examples to that.

#### Premium Widgets
Premium widgets are widgets that requires configuration done from third-party party or are using API Keys that you will need to setup in order to make the widget work and show any data. Please see the explanation and configuration examples for each widget in their sections. Some Premium widgets that require a third-party account are not free to use! Please make sure you select a free developers tier and setup / configure budget limits.

Examples are the calendar widget which is using Google to fetch your calendar or the Phillips Hue widget which requires you to have an HUE account setup.

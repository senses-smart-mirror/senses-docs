# Widget Introduction

Widgets are the components which provide the data on the Smart Mirror Screen. They can be added onto the Smart Mirror with the Senses - Smart Mirror App. 

### Simple Widgets
Are widgets that requires no extra setup and can be used straight out of the box. The spacer, clock and profile widgets are examples to that.

### Premium Widgets
Premium widgets are widgets that requires configuration done from third-party party or are using API Keys that you will need to setup in order to make the widget work and show any data. Please see the explanation and configuration examples for each widget in their sections. Some Premium widgets that require a third-party account are not free to use! Please make sure you select a free developers tier and setup / configure budget limits.

Examples are the calendar widget which is using Google to fetch your calendar or the Phillips Hue widget which requires you to have an HUE developer account setup.

### Default widget configuration options

Every widget has a set of configuration options which are not related to the content or data of the widget but rather the design.

The following options are available for every widget:

| Option      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Show widget      | Show or hide the widget on the grid. When you choose to hide the widget it will not fetch any new data.       |
| Show icon in header title   |  Show or Hide the icon in the title of the widget       |
| Show widget based on time | The time in which the widget should show in the grid. Format: <em>07:10-15:50</em> |
| Widget width | The width in pixels of the widget |
| Widget design | Different designs for the widget |

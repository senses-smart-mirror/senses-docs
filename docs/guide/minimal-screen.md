# Minimal Screen <small>(wake up screen)</small>

The Minimal Screen (or also called wake up screen) is a special designed minimalistic version of all widgets. In this screen you will not see the full data from widgets but rather a minimal version only showing basic information. 

You can enable this screen through the Senses - App. In the Senses - App you will also need to enable the widgets that you want to display on this minimal screen. Please note that every widget must still be somewhere placed on the grid in order to show up on the minimal screen.

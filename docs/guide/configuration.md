# Configuration

This section will give more information on how to configure your Senses - Smart Mirror.

From a fresh installation you will only see the default profile with the default configuration. The default configuration will show the Clock and Weather widget as well as the QR widget. <em>If you scan the QR widget the Senses - Smart Mirror app will open on your Phone!</em>. From now on you will use this webapp to configure your Smart Mirror.

## Profile

<!-- TODO ADD MORE... -->

As you noticed you are not able to change to change widgets on the default profile. Go ahead to the <strong>Profile Screen</strong> (in the Senses - Smart Mirror App) and create your first profile. 

1. Specify the name of your profile
2. Click Save
3. Switch to your new profile

Your new profile is now active and ready to use!

## General Settings

To configure your Smart Mirror even more you can change some general (global) settings. For example, change the color scheme (theme), change the font or enable animation for the widgets in the bottom sections.

More explanation on the individual settings can be found [here](/guide/general-settings.md).

## Wallpaper

The Wallpaper module can be used to set a background image to your Smart Mirror or add a background filter. This module uses [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) to get the images. Other features you can use:

- Background Filter
- Background Blur
- Background images through a specific collection from Unsplash
- Background Border Radius
- Interval to specify the time between cycling the images

## Grid and Design mode

The Smart Mirror uses a grid where you can place widgets. The grid is divided in a left column, right column and a center column. When you open the Senses - Smart Mirror app you will directly see the left and right column. The center column can be opened from the navigation in the bottom.

From <strong>navigation -> settings -> design</strong> you can open the design mode. In the design mode you can drag the grid system up and down in order to view all widgets or add more widgets.

## Widgets

After you are done with the general configuration you are ready to place widgets on your Smart Mirror. All widgets are configurable through there own settings. After adding a widget to the grid the widget settings screen will be displayed.

### Senses Scripts

Senses script is a place where you can find several scripts that also help with working on the Senses - Smart Mirror. Basically it has the same functionality as the Senses CLI but then in the form of ```.sh``` scripts. We would advice to use the Senses CLI as we will push more often updates there but in case you need you can use the scripts instead.

# Profiles 

With <strong>profiles</strong> you can create multiple layouts for the Smart Mirror. You can have a profile for the morning to display your calendar and commute time and a diffrent profile for the evening where you want to see the latest Crypto data. 

You can make new profiles, delete a profile or edit a profile in the Senses - App. <em>You cannot change the default profile.</em>

#### Upgrading

When you are upgrading the Senses - software the profiles will be automatically backed up and restored.

#### Welcome Message
Every profile can have a welcome message. The welcome message will be displayed when switching to that profile. You can also use the Profile Widget to show the welcome message.

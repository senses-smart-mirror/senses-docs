# Requirements

Senses - Smart Mirror is developed to work smooth on <strong>Raspberry Pi 3 & 4</strong>. As we do expect it will work on other versions of Raspberry PI as well we cannot guarantee this. From now on we will only develop and test on Raspberry Pi 3+.

#### Software Requirements

The following software requirements are required in order to run Senses - Smart Mirror.

1. Node 14+

#### Operating System

Please note that you will have to install the full version of Raspbian. Please note that <strong>Electron</strong> requires a desktop environment so any Lite version will not work!

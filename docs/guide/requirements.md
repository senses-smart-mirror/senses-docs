# Requirements

Senses - Smart Mirror is developed to work smoothly on <strong>Raspberry Pi 3 & 4</strong>. As we do expect it will work on other versions of Raspberry PI as well we cannot guarantee this. From now on we will only develop and test on Raspberry Pi 3+.

#### Software Requirements

The following software requirements are required in order to run Senses - Smart Mirror.

1. Raspberry PI OS* installed
2. Node 14+

<em>* This guide only explains about Senses - Software. We do not give any advice about installing the Raspberry PI as there are already a lot of good tutorials out there.</em>

#### Operating System

Please note that you will have to install the full version of Raspbian. Please note that <strong>Electron</strong> requires a desktop environment so any <strong>Lite</strong> version will not work!

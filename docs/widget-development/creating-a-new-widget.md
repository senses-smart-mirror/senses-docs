# Creating a new Widget

::: tip CLI
  For this we assume you already installed the Senses - Smart Mirror CLI [Github](https://github.com/senses-smart-mirror/senses-cli) - [NPM](https://npmjs.com)
:::

#### Steps

1. Create a new widget with:

``` bash
senses widget:create
```

2. The CLI will prompt for:
  - The name of the widget.
  - The folder where to create the widget <small>(type . (dot) to provide the folder you are currently in)</small>.

3. The result will look like this:

<img src="/create-widget.png" alt="Create a new Widget" width="500"/>

4. Your widget is now created!

#### Continue to developing

In the <strong>"Gui"</strong> and the <strong>"Server"</strong> folder you will find the files you will customize to display your data!
